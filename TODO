PlanetSim Releases
--------------------

20th July 2005: 3.0 Candidate : Renewed simulator
----------------------------------
  - New structure of the simulator kernel:
    - Includes all factories as in the last versions.
    - Added the behaviours in the internal simulator kernel structure.
    - Added the ability to get different outputs following some results type (by default, GML and Pajek).
  - Added a Trivial P2P to show how works an overlay very simple.
  - Fixed any other minors bugs.
  
NOTE: This version is incompatible with the rest. We recommend to update to this last version.



10th May 2005: 2.0.4 Alpha : Symphony bugfixes
----------------------------------
  - Optimization in planet.chord.ChordNode.FindPredListener: the internal Hashtable has been replaced for three attributes. The ChordNode has been updated too.
  - Fixed bug on the SymphonyNode.process(int) method, that not processes all permited incoming messages in certain cases.
  - Fixed bug on the certain behaviours of Symphony (planet.symphony.behaviours): it don't update the SymphonyNode.stabilized flag
    and don't decrement the counter of delivered application data message.

18th April 2005: 2.0.3 Alpha : SymphonyId bugfix
----------------------------------
  - Fixed bug on the SymphonyId(String, String) constructor: It always returned 0.0 for any key.

11th April 2005: 2.0.2 Alpha : NetworkImpl bugfix
----------------------------------
  - Fixed bug on the NetworkImpl on joinNodes(int) method, to ensure a randomized selection of bootstrap nodes.
  - Fixed bug on the behaviours properties for Symphony (conf/Behaviours.properties), to set the DataBehaviour 
    for LOCAL and REMOTE application level RouteMessages, and RoutingBehaviour for the other REMOTE cases.
      

8th April 2005: 2.0.1 Alpha : SymphonyId bugfix
----------------------------------
  - Fixed bug for key building using the SymphonyId implementation. Modified the SymphonyId(byte[]).
  - Fixed bug on the implementation of the planet.symphony.behaviours.DataBehaviour
  - Fixed bug on the application of this DataBehaviour, specified in conf/Behaviours.properties
  - Remain: Guarantee not route an application level message, when the DataBehaviour, after invoking
    the application.forward(RouteMessage) returns false.

6th April 2005: 2.0 Alpha : Behaviours and GML output
----------------------------------
  - New manner to implement the overlay nodes: the behaviours. Has been added new
    elements in the framework to work with behaviours. Each of these offers the 
    control of a part of the overlay protocol.
  - Permits build a GML output for the build network to view into YED (included into
    this distribution).
  - Added new upcalls and downcalls between the application and overlay layer.
  - The Symphony implementation has been replaced with another one based on behaviours,
  - Remain: Guarantee the same efficiency and speedup found in the earlier release.


1.0 : The begining of the PlanetSim
----------------------------------
  - Framework for overlay simulation
  - Chord and Symphony implementation
  - Optimized simulator: 
     - 8,5 sec and 2515 steps for network stabilization of 1000 Chord nodes.
     - 2,1 sec and 2149 steps for network stabilization of 1000 Symphony nodes.
