1. Content
------------------------

This directory contains all *.bat and *.sh to run all existing
tests in the planet.test package and subpackages.

The distribution of these scripts is the same than the
planet.test package hierarchy, using the name of the main class
and the subpackages to naming the script file. For example, 
the scripts that execute the test planet.test.bad.SimNetTest 
are called bad.SimNetTest.sh and bad.SimNetTest.bat, omitting 
the package name "planet.test".


2. Ant compatibility
-----------------------

There are planetsim.properties and build.xml for ant compatibility.
The build.xml has been tested and fully functional.

See the results of "ant targets" in the command line.

IMPORTANT: You need to copy the $PLANETSIM/lib/junit.jar to the $ANT_HOME/lib
to successfully run "ant test".


3. How to run tests
-----------------------

If you have modified any class or added any new test, you have to
run "$ ant jar" or "> ant jar" in this directory to build the 
../lib/planetsim.jar distribution file.

One recommend to run any script as follows:

On Windows systems:
...\> script_name.bat > out.txt

On *nix systems:
$ ./script_name.sh > out.txt

to capture the output to the results file named 'out.txt'.



4. GML graphs
-----------------------

This release is able to generate GML graphs representations.
To open any *.gml output file, use the scripts open_GML_viewer.bat/.sh
to see the results.

The Yed library is used. See ../lib/*_yed.html for more details.



3. Feedback
-----------------------

errors. Email us to Jordi Pujol <jordi.pujol@estudiants.urv.es>
